"""LM experiment config schema (target spec, data settings, tiled site specs, full YAML
tree) PLUS the LM YAML→`BuiltRun` conversion.

This module reads the canonical `LMExperimentConfig` schema directly and builds the engine's
`BuiltRun` bundle (`param_decomp.core.built_run`) — the pydantic `pd` / `cadence`
verbatim plus the resolved target / data / CI-fn arch / eval — asserting loudly on anything
the JAX trainer doesn't implement. The composition entry (`run.py`) calls `load_config` /
`build_from_schema`; stored-run consumers rebuild the same canonical schema.

The authored `decomposition.sites` c-specs (`GluTransformerCSpec` / `SimpleMlpCSpec`, keys
typed by each target family's own matrix vocabulary) resolve here into the block-structured
`SiteTree` (`resolve_site_tree`) — the layer index carried as DATA, never parsed back out
of a site name — which the CI-arch resolvers (`resolve_lm_ci_arch`) consume directly.
