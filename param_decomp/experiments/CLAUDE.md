# `param_decomp/experiments/`

Experiment glue + the per-domain COMPOSITION ROOTS, torch-free. Training is JAX through the
generic core engine (`param_decomp.core.run.run_decomposition_training`, a pure library that reads
the pydantic `PDConfig` / `Cadence` directly). Each toy domain's `run.py` and LM's `training.py` are composition roots: read the run YAML → build the target / data loader / `config.BuiltRun` → call the
engine. LM runs through `python -m param_decomp.experiments.lm.run` in an allocation
provided by the caller; the toy domains (TMS, ResidMLP) run on CPU
in-process via their module mains (`python -m param_decomp.experiments.{tms,resid_mlp}.run`). The shared experiment YAML schema + the shared
run-identity helper (`run_instance`) live in `experiments/config.py`; the toy CI-arch
builder is `experiments/toy_config.py::build_toy_ci_arch`; each domain's `config.py`
carries its own target/data schema + (for the LM) its `BuiltRun` build.

## `pd` optimizers

`pd.components_optimizer` (the V/U group) and `pd.ci_fn_optimizer` are
`core.configs.AnyOptimizerConfig` — a union discriminated on `type`, **not** a single
`OptimizerConfig`:

| `type` | class | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `adamw` | `AdamWOptimizerConfig` | the canonical one; `type` may be omitted (a `type`-less optimizer block validates as `adamw`) |
| `muon` | `MuonOptimizerConfig` | experimental, must be spelled explicitly |

The literal is `adamw`, never `adam`. `adam` IS a valid literal elsewhere in the schema —
`AdamPGDConfig.type`, the persistent-PGD adversary's own source optimizer
(`pd.loss_metrics[].optimizer` under a `PersistentPGD*` term) — a different field with a
different union; the two never substitute.

Both blocks are honored exactly as written: `run_state.build_optimizers` reads the full
`ScheduleConfig` (an arbitrary knot curve), both `betas` and `weight_decay`, and chains a
global-norm clip only where `grad_clip_norm` is non-null. A schedule is `max_val` times a
piecewise `frac` curve over normalized time `t = step / (total_steps - 1)`; a bare float
is the constant schedule, so the seats spell the cosine decay out as knots. The shape
below is the METHOD's recipe (SPEC S20) — what the maintained seats run, not a subspace
the schema enforces:

```yaml
pd:
  components_optimizer:            # type omitted => adamw
    lr_schedule:
      max_val: 7.0e-05
      points:
        - {at: 0.0, frac: 1.0}
        - {at: 1.0, frac: 0.1, interp: cosine}
    betas: [0.9, 0.999]
    weight_decay: 0.0
    grad_clip_norm: 0.01
  ci_fn_optimizer:
    lr_schedule:
      max_val: 7.0e-05
      points:
        - {at: 0.0, frac: 1.0}
        - {at: 1.0, frac: 0.1, interp: cosine}
    betas: [0.9, 0.999]
    weight_decay: 0.0
    grad_clip_norm: null
```

## Toy domains (TMS, ResidMLP)

The TMS and ResidualMLP toys are LAB experiments that call the core engine as a library
(the core itself has zero target-specific code). The toy *targets* live in the targets
distribution — `param_decomp/targets/{tms,resid_mlp}.py`: the JAX `DecomposedModel`
(sites, pure fns, MSE `recon_loss_fn`), the frozen target (`eqx.Module`), from-scratch
in-process pretrain (`pretrain_*_target`), the ground-truth identity-CI eval
(`identity_ci_error` + the single-feature probe), and the `*TargetConfig` dataclass
carried on `BuiltRun.target` (satisfies the core `built_run.TargetSites` protocol).
Each `experiments/{tms,resid_mlp}/` carries:
- `run.py` — the toy composition root (module main): builds the core `BuiltRun` from the
  canonical schema via the public shared helpers
  (`config.run_instance` / `toy_config.build_toy_ci_arch`),
  pretrains + builds the target, and calls `run_decomposition_training` with a synthetic
  `sample_batch` plus domain-bound identity/PGD/UV eval operations. CPU, synchronous, no
  SLURM — and no `runtime:` section in the YAML at all: a toy is single-device by
  construction (`sharding.single_device_mesh`, which asserts that world rather than
  absorbing whatever devices are visible), so the engine's substrate arguments are
  literals here (`ddp` placement, no remat, no `compiler_options`), not config.
  The native toy operation ALSO logs the per-site-permuted CI heatmap alongside each checkpoint
  (`toy_uv_eval.render_permuted_ci_heatmap`, unconditional, no config gate — the visual
  companion to the `IdentityCIError`/dense-CI-error scalars: each site permutes toward
  ITS target pattern, identity via Hungarian assignment or dense via column-mass sort —
  e.g. TMS's frozen `hidden_layers.*` and ResidMLP's `mlp_out` target dense, not identity)
  and renders the config-gated `UVPlots` figure when the run's `eval.metrics` names it
  (`toy_uv_eval.render_uv_metric`): the toys feed `UVPlots` their probe CI as the
  column-permutation source and their small on-host V/U, sharing `slow_eval.render_uv_figure`
  / `plot_uv_matrices` with the LM in-loop tier (SPEC S28). Toy `eval:` is a domain-specific
  closed schema: fresh `PGDReconLoss` runs against the target's own `recon_loss_fn` on
  independent synthetic batches; optional `UVPlots` and target-generic `WellTemperedness`
  operations run on the slow cadence (the latter samples the actual eval distribution, not the
  single-feature probe) — read off
  its own `slow` declaration, the same one the LM binder reads (`eval_config.schedule_for`;
  SPEC S29), never a per-family choice. LM-only
  token metrics refuse when toy evaluator construction reaches them. Ground-truth identity/dense CI scoring remains the
  toy runner's native validation pass on the train-log cadence.
- `configs/*.yaml` — the canonical `experiments.{tms,resid_mlp}.config` schema (TMS: 5-2 /
  40-10 / the `-id` deeper variants; ResidMLP: 1l/2l/3l).

The TMS deeper variant (`n_hidden_layers>0`, the `-id` configs) and the toy `global_mlp`
CI arch (`type: global_mlp`) are wired end-to-end (the global arch dispatches through the
core `init_train_state` via `toy_config.build_toy_ci_arch`). The shipped ResidMLP configs
all use per-site `layerwise_mlp` with `hidden_dims: [400]` at `C: 200` per site — wide
enough to avoid the output bottleneck the `global_mlp` variant escapes.
Toy clustering is not wired (`load_run` is LM-only).

## Picking a CI-fn arch — and `n_blocks: 0`

`CIFn.has_position_axis` must equal the target's (`core.run_state.init_decomposition` asserts
it). The chunkwise transformer is the positioned arch whose blocks self-attend OVER the
position axis; the LM schema also admits `type: global_mlp` (the tPD paper's LM CI net) —
ONE shared MLP over every decomposed block's `input_tap` taps, pointwise per token, so it
is positioned with no cross-position read at all.

For a sequence target that is the point. It is fatal when the position axis is large and
derived: a pair-shaped target (an AF2-style pair representation, where a position is a residue
PAIR) turns a 128-residue crop into 16384 positions — 16k×16k attention per chunk per forward,
several times per step. Infeasible, not slow.

**The answer is `LayerwiseMLPCIArch(has_position_axis=True)`.** The MLP arches were positionless by
DECLARATION, not by construction — `SiteMLP.__call__` is `[*leading, d_in] -> [*leading, C]`,
pointwise over every leading axis, so the same weights serve `[batch, d]` and
`[batch, position, d]` alike. The arch now carries the axis (the target's shape, not the MLP's
property) and the runtime checks it against the model. Pinned by
`param_decomp/core/tests/test_ci_fn_positioned_mlp.py`.

`n_blocks: 0` on the chunkwise arch also runs and is also position-local (pinned by
`test_ci_fn_zero_blocks.py`), but it is a weaker instrument: the chunkwise path RMS-norms
every tap before `in_proj`, so a blockless chunk is `RMSNorm → affine` — no learned
nonlinearity, no hidden layer, and **invariant to tap magnitude** (measured: `f(x) == f(7x)`
to 3.6e-7, where the MLP's outputs differ by 14). Use it as a cheap baseline, not as the
position-local CI function.

The LM schema (`ChunkwiseTransformerCiConfig.n_blocks`) stays `PositiveInt`: an LM's positions
are tokens, cross-position CI is what that arch is for there, and 0 would be a typo rather than
a choice. `n_blocks: 0` is available to any lab whose own schema admits it.

## Layout

The `ExperimentConfig` schema base (domain subclasses bind concrete
`target`/`decomposition`/`data`) + the shared validation / run-identity helpers live in
`experiments/config.py`; `EvalConfig` lives in `experiments/eval_config.py`; the toy
authored CI configs (`LayerwiseMlpCiConfig` / `GlobalMlpCiConfig`) plus
`build_toy_ci_arch` live in `experiments/toy_config.py` (`WandbConfig` / `ResumeProvenance` are
core, in `param_decomp.core.configs`; the engine's `BuiltRun` bundle is core, in
`param_decomp.core.built_run`); the LM schema + LM build (`LMExperimentConfig`, `LMTargetConfig`,
`LMDataConfig`, the `target.spec` union, the authored LM CI union (`LMCiConfig`:
`ChunkwiseTransformerCiConfig` + its `attention`/`ffn` unions, and the LM `GlobalMlpCiConfig`
— its own class, not the toy one: it selects taps via `ChunkInputTap`, resolved by
`resolve_lm_ci_arch` over ALL decomposed blocks) AND the
tiled site specs + their resolution (`GluTransformerCSpec`/`SimpleMlpCSpec` over
`LayerSelection`, keys typed by each target family's matrix vocabulary;
`resolve_site_tree` → the block-structured `SiteTree` the chunkwise CI resolver consumes) —
target-anatomy vocabulary, so it lives in the domain that IS transformers —
`build_from_schema` / `load_config`) in `experiments/lm/config.py`; the toy schemas in
`experiments/{tms,resid_mlp}/config.py`. Core (`param_decomp.core.configs`) carries no authored
`decomposition.ci` config and no tiled site spec — only the resolved CI-fn arches
(`param_decomp.core.ci_fn`) and the family grammar (`param_decomp.core.family`).

## Sites and the family grammar

Read `param_decomp/core/family.py`'s module docstring before authoring a
`decomposition.sites` c-spec or a new target. In short: site names are layer-indexed
(`layers.{i}.self_attn.q_proj`, `h.{i}.mlp.c_fc`, …), the spelling and the within-block
matrix order are declared as DATA by the target's `ArchFamily`, and the c-spec's `cs` keys
are typed by that same vocabulary — so which layers get decomposed is a config choice
(`layers: {kind: all | range | list}`), not a target property. A new target declares its
family and gets any layer subset for free; layers without sites run the plain frozen block.

One deliberately narrow exception is the `glu_transformer_q_head` c-spec: it selects one
query head in one layer with one C. The target exposes the normal q-projection site name,
but its `SiteSpec.d_out` is one `head_dim`; masked forwards replace only that head's output
slice and leave all other query heads frozen. Use this arm when the experimental unit and
component budget are explicitly per head. It cannot be mixed with other sites in one run.

## LM `target.spec`

The LM target is a discriminated union on `kind`:

```yaml
target:
  spec:
    kind: hf                            # HuggingFace model
    model_class: transformers.LlamaForCausalLM
    model_name: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B

# or
target:
  spec:
    kind: pretrained                    # in-repo lab-pretrained model
    model_class: param_decomp.experiments.lm.pretrain.models.llama_simple_mlp.LlamaSimpleMLP
    run_path: <entity>/<project>/runs/<run_id>   # the W&B pretrain run — see below

# or
target:
  spec:
    kind: hf_weights_in_vendored        # HF weights loaded into a vendored, componentizable arch
    model_class: param_decomp.experiments.lm.vendored.llama_3_1.model.VendoredLlama
    model_name: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B

# or
target:
  spec:
    kind: hf                            # Qwen3-8B-Base (same vendored JAX target + QK-norm)
    model_class: transformers.Qwen3ForCausalLM
    model_name: Qwen/Qwen3-8B-Base
```

### `kind: pretrained` — `run_path`

`run_path` names the W&B pretrain run whose checkpoint is the target's weights — a name,
never a location. It resolves to the local store entry
`<data_root>/pretrain_cache/<project>-<run_id>/` (one `model_step_<N>.safetensors` plus
`model_config.yaml`), fetched from W&B on first use and read from disk ever after
(`infra/pretrain_cache.py::resolved_cache_dir` — a complete entry short-circuits, so cold
starts are idempotent across ranks and requeues; `targets/` stays network-free). A local
`param_decomp.pretrain.train` run writes the same layout directly as its output, so
pretrain-here-then-decompose never touches W&B.

Torch-era pretrain runs ship `model_step_<N>.pt`, which this loader can't read. The fetch
downloads it anyway and then fails pointing at the local file and the converter at git
tag `torch-oracle` — conversion needs torch, which the library deliberately doesn't depend on.

`kind: hf`/`hf_weights_in_vendored` model names must be in `experiments/lm/config.py::HF_MODEL_VARIANTS`
(Llama-3.1-8B; dense Qwen3 0.6B/1.7B/4B/8B/14B Base and post-trained) — anything else
refuses at convert time. A Qwen3 run needs a Qwen3-tokenized prestaged dataset
(`prestage_tokenized --tokenizer_name <the selected Qwen checkpoint>`).

## LM `data`

`data` carries two required dataset references — `train` and the held-out `eval` split —
each a discriminated union on `kind`:

```yaml
data:
  train:
    kind: name                    # a named store dataset (the portable form)
    name: fineweb_llama_tok_2048  # pile_neox_tok_512 for LlamaSimpleMLP
  eval:
    kind: name
    name: fineweb_llama_tok_2048_eval

# or, per split:
  train:
    kind: dir                     # ad-hoc escape hatch: an explicit shard dir
    dir: /abs/path/to/shards
```

A store name resolves to `<data_root>/datasets/<name>` (`infra.dataset_store`); the
deployment populates the store (the root CLAUDE.md describes ours). The dataset dir is self-describing:
`meta.json` (`infra.dataset_store.DatasetMeta`) carries its seq_len and tokenizer, read
at load time — prestage writes it alongside the shards. Tip reads pinned configs through
this same strict schema; older shapes require their original revision or an external converter.

The JAX prediction tensor is always the final logits (there is no `output_extract` —
it was a torch-era field and current configs reject it). The `model_class` strings
are NOT imported by the JAX trainer — `experiments/lm/config.py::resolve_decomposition`
only asserts the class identity (`kind: hf` matches the family's full class string; the
other kinds match the class-name suffix) and routes to its own vendored JAX arch
(`pretrained` LlamaSimpleMLP -> the pretrain-cache loader, `hf_weights_in_vendored`
Llama -> `vendored_jax`). The dotted `model_class` is a stable identifier only, never
imported.

The path schemas (`topology/path_schemas.py`) cover the pretrain (`GPT2*`,
`LlamaSimple*`) and HF GLU (`Llama`, `Qwen3`) architectures used to name harvested
sites consistently.

## Exact-k LM readout

`HardTopKCEandKLLosses` is a slow, evaluation-only LM metric. For each token and each
site independently, it ranks the learned lower CI values and replaces them with an
exact binary mask containing `k` ones. Stable sorting makes ties deterministic. This
isolates hard selection from training: it is not a straight-through estimator and does
not change the learned CI function or objective.

```yaml
- type: HardTopKCEandKLLosses
  ks: [8, 16, 32, 64]
```

Each `k` must fit every configured site's C. Results are logged as
`eval/hard_top_k/{kl,ce_difference}_k{K}`. A multi-site target selects k separately at
each site; it never pools components across sites.

## `runtime.launch_env` (rank env / XLA flags)

The rank env (XLA client flags, NCCL/host-memory knobs) is config-driven via
`runtime.launch_env` (`param_decomp.experiments.lm.runtime.LaunchEnv`), so `config.yaml`
fully captures the environment a run executed with — A/B a flag in the YAML, not in
the launcher. `lm/run.py` exports `LaunchEnv.as_env()` before importing JAX, so it applies
on every path including a direct module invocation. Machine-specific environment such as
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` belongs to the caller rather than the authored run configuration.

XLA *compiler* flags go through `runtime.compiler_options` instead (passed natively to
every jit, in the compile-cache key). REQUIRED, no default, no merge — every run's
flags trace to a visible authored token: `tuned-v1` = the frozen production set
(`TUNED_V1_COMPILER_OPTIONS` in `lm/runtime.py`, the one code copy — a changed tuned
set is a new preset name, never an edit); `bare` = `{}` (true XLA defaults, the
debugging baseline); or an explicit `xla_*`-keyed dict, used VERBATIM as the run's
complete flag set (non-`xla_*` keys refuse at parse).

```yaml
runtime:
  replicate: 4
  fsdp: 8
  tp: 1
  compiler_options: tuned-v1   # or bare, or an explicit complete xla_* dict
  launch_env:
    xla_python_client_allocator: platform
    env: { SOME_ONE_OFF_VAR: "1" }
```

## W&B grouping and tags

The shipped TMS and ResidualMLP configs include `wandb:` and require authentication. Tests
that must not contact W&B should use a temporary config with `wandb: null`; local
`metrics.jsonl` output is still written in the run directory.

Launchers may stamp a W&B group and tags when `wandb:` is configured:

- **`--group`** sets wandb's first-class `group` field — used by the UI's native
  collapsing and matched by workspace filters via `ws.Metric("Group")`.
- **`--tags`** adds wandb tags — orthogonal to `group`, many per run, user-defined.
