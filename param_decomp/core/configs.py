"""The torch-free pydantic config schema for the algorithm core.

Every algorithm-level config class lives here (or in the sibling `base_config` /
`schedule` modules): routing, the explicit (toy) site spec, loss-metric configs,
eval-metric configs, the top-level `PDConfig` / `Cadence`, the placement table the
engine resolves, and the `wandb.config` shaping helpers. Depends only on pydantic /
numpy / pyyaml / annotated-types (via `base_config`), so non-trainer consumers validate
the same YAML run configs without pulling jax/wandb.

Experiment-level schema (the `ExperimentConfig` base and its LM / TMS / ResidMLP
subclasses, each binding concrete `target`/`decomposition`/`data` sections) lives
lab-side under `param_decomp/experiments/` — including the authored
`decomposition.ci` configs, the tiled LM site specs, and the LM's compute substrate
(`runtime:`), which speak each domain's vocabulary. Core carries only the RESOLVED CI-fn
arches (`ci_fn.py`) and the resolved flat sites.

    Example: `pd.loss_metrics: [{type: "ImportanceMinimalityLoss", coeff: 0.1}]`
    becomes `pd.loss_metrics.ImpMin.coeff: 0.1`, and the raw `pd.loss_metrics` list is
    removed so wandb doesn't also log it as an opaque JSON blob. A metric type with no
    entry in `METRIC_SHORT_NAMES` falls back to its raw type string.
