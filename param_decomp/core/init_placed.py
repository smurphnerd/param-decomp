"""Seeded init → placed arrays, with no host-side full tree.

Each helper computes the declared shardings on an `eqx.filter_eval_shape`'d abstract
value, then runs the seeded init under `jax.jit(init, out_shardings=...)` so each device
generates only its own shard — an eager `device_put` of a host tree onto a multi-process
non-replicated sharding triggers a `process_allgather` (a host allocation of the FULL
unsharded tree per process). A non-dividing declared shard axis is a loud crash at
placement construction / inside `.shardings` (fail-fast), never a silent replicate.

Compile-time doctrine: keep seeded inits FEW-OUTPUTS-under-jit — a jit returning n_sites
(hundreds of) sharded outputs, or n_chunks unrolled RNG bodies, is a multi-minute
SPMD/layout compile. vmap-stack over the same per-site/per-chunk keys (bit-identical
values), then fan out with a trivial slice jit. `init_component_stacks_placed` is the
template; `init_ci_fn_placed` / `init_sources_sharded` follow it.
