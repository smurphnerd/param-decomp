"""The generic single-pool VPD training step over a `DecomposedModel` (SPEC §4).

One `jax.jit` step: clean target forward → CI envelope → per-persistent-term supplemental
ascents + per-fresh-term sign-PGD ascents (`adversary.py`) → faith + imp-min +
the recon loss TERMS (`recon.py`; each term = plan × mask-source strategy, SPEC
S10') + optional nonlinearity-locality term (S36) → one fused backward over
(components, ci_fn, all persistent sources) → optimizer updates → each persistent
term's final ascent. The default `e2e` adversary retakes only its output-reconstruction
source gradient when the outer term also includes hidden-activation reconstruction; an
explicit `term` adversary reuses the fused graph and ascends the complete term (SPEC
S13'/S14'/S23). All trainable state is fp32 masters (SPEC N1); forwards run in bf16
via explicit casts.

Schedules (imp-min p anneal, source-LR warmup, every scheduled loss coefficient) are
computed inside the step from `state.step`, so the jit signature is stable across the
whole run (SPEC S9, S13); each coefficient resolves ONCE at the top of the step and only
values flow into the loss math.
Per-term RNG: term i draws from `fold_in(step_key, offset + i)` in config-list order
(SPEC R1) — offset 1 for the main grid reproduces the pre-unification production key
derivation exactly.

The factories bind explicit ``ForwardSubstrate`` and ``ReconGrid`` values while keeping
the plain and targeted step bodies separate and readable.
