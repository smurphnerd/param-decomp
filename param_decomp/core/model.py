"""`DecomposedModel` — the interface a vendored target implements for the generic trainer.

The trainer (`train.py`) is abstract over the target model: it sees an ordered set of
decomposed **sites** (SPEC §1.2) and a handful of methods on the model `eqx.Module`. The
model carries its FROZEN target weights as fields; the TRAINABLE V/U (`vu`) is passed to
the forward methods explicitly (separate lifecycle). Everything at the boundary is keyed
by site name (flat dicts, torch-module-path style) — except `weight_deltas`, keyed like
`vu.stacks` so its only consumer (`faithfulness_loss`) never slices the stack-sharded
persist layout per site; how a target lays its parameters out internally (e.g. the Llama
target's stacked layer axis) is its own business.

The activation WAIST comes in exactly TWO shapes: positionless `[B, d]` (masks/CI
`[B, C]` — the toys) or with one position axis `[B, P, d]` (masks/CI `[B, P, C]` — an
LM, whose position axis is the token sequence). `has_position_axis` declares which;
`Positionless` / `Positioned` carry the run-scoped extents. Those are the waist's shapes;
a mask's leading axes match only in RANK, and are size 1 wherever the adversary's
`source_shape` says so (`SiteMasks`). Batch is ever-present and
semantics-free (the data/shard axis); CI is always independent over every leading axis.
Masking, routing, source scopes, imp-min, and normalization all operate over the opaque
leading prefix. The three EDGES are generic too — the model INPUT consumed by
`clean_forward` / `masked_forward` (tokens for an LM, a dict for a bio target), the model
OUTPUT carried by `ForwardResult.output` (`Any` — logits, a tuple of heads, coords), and
the recon comparison (`recon_loss_fn`, `kl_per_position` for an LM). Activation identity
and capture lowering are target-owned. Core passes immutable canonical names into the
forward and receives a strict one-key-to-one-array capture dictionary back.

The frozen weights ride on the model `eqx.Module` and reach the jitted step as a pytree
ARG (`eqx.filter_jit` traces the array leaves). Never close over the model in a jit: a
frozen 8B target captured as a constant bakes multi-GB weights into the HLO.
