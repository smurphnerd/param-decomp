"""JAX-native slow (plot-type) eval metrics — a LIBRARY for the in-loop slow tier (`run.py`)
and the toy eval functions (`param_decomp/experiments/{tms,resid_mlp}`). Slow eval is
IN-LOOP ONLY; there is no offline/retrospective CLI.

`eval.py` runs the FAST scalar tier in-loop (CE/KL, CI-L0, the fresh-PGD probe). The
SLOW tier is the heavy plot metrics: `CIHistograms`, `ComponentActivationDensity`,
`CIMeanPerComponent` (the torch eval-metric classes of the same names). Every one of them
is a reduction over the per-site causal-importance arrays from a masked-free forward, then
a numpy/matplotlib plot. The forward + reduction is JAX; the plotting is framework-agnostic
(it mirrors the torch `param_decomp/eval_metrics/plotting.py` reductions on numpy
arrays, no torch). `accumulate_site_reductions` / `render_slow_eval_figures` / `accumulate_position_ci` /
`render_permutation_figures` are what the LM slow-tier operations bind
(`experiments/lm/diagnostic_eval_operations.py`); the toys use only the UV figure helpers
(`render_uv_figure` / `plot_uv_matrices`).

The slow tier runs IN-LOOP on `eval.slow_every` next to the fast pass (`run.py`,
SPEC S28/S29), reusing the fast pass's eval batches and logging `slow_eval/*` on the live
`_step` axis from a rank-0 background thread.

Cross-batch reductions are exact under micro-batching: density/mean accumulate
SUM-over-positions + a position count, divided once at the end (token-weighted mean,
uniform `(B, T)` makes it the plain mean). `CIHistograms` is the exception — its two value
histograms bin against each batch's own min/max, and counts on different edges do not sum,
so they require `eval.n_steps=1`. It
ALSO opts into a per-token CI density heatmap (`density_heatmap_n_bins`): a per-component
on-device bincount into log-spaced `[1e-9, 1]` bands over the same forward's `lower`,
accumulated over EVERY batch — a small `(C, n_bins + 1)` reduction, so unlike the value
histograms it costs nothing to carry across batches. Rendered as
`figures/ci_density_heatmap` (`plot_ci_density_heatmap`).

It also computes the two SCALAR hidden-acts recon eval metrics (`CIHiddenActsReconLoss`,
`StochasticHiddenActsReconLoss`) natively — per decomposed site, the summed MSE between
the masked-model and target-model site OUTPUT activations, divided once by the element
count (`hidden_acts_eval.py`). Those request the same canonical output keys from clean and masked forwards (SPEC S31)
and are emitted as scalars under the torch log keys (`<ClassName>/<site>` + a combined `<ClassName>`).

The three CONFIG-GATED permutation metrics (`PermutedCIPlots`, `UVPlots`,
`IdentityCIError`) are recomputed natively too, off the run's `eval.metrics` block
from the resolved domain eval plan. They share one column permutation per site — identity (scipy
`linear_sum_assignment` on `-CI`) or dense (by column mass) — derived from a per-site
upper-leaky CI matrix. `PermutedCIPlots` and `IdentityCIError` use the LM batch-mean
`(position, C)` matrix (`make_position_ci_step` / `accumulate_position_ci`) and are LM-only
(they need the position axis). `UVPlots` reorders the V/U columns by the same kind of
permutation and is the one figure metric usable for ANY decomposition: the toys feed it
their probe CI as the permutation source (`render_uv_figure`), the LM in-loop tier feeds it
the position-CI upper matrix. The LM in-loop UVPlots does a NAIVE host gather of the
C-sharded V/U — cheap for the toys (small, replicated, already on host) but it OOMs / breaks
at production C BY DESIGN: no special handling, the gather is the cost.
